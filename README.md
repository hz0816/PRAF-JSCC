## ðŸ“– Introduction  

**PRAF-JSCC** is a novel Joint_Source-Channel_Coding_framework designed for image super-resolution (SR) tasks in semantic communication.  

- **Why semantic SR?**  
  Traditional communication systems focus on bit-level accuracy, but semantic communication transmits *meaning* directly. In SR tasks, this allows the receiver to directly reconstruct high-resolution images without complex post-processing, which is crucial for applications like **telemedicine** and **satellite imaging**.  

- **Key challenges:**  
  1. Efficiently extracting deep semantic information from LR images for HR reconstruction.  
  2. Ensuring robust transmission under wireless channels.  

- **Our solution:**  
  âœ… **PRAF (Progressive Refinement Attention Feature)** module  
  - Progressive feature extraction for shallow & deep semantic features  
  - Dynamic SNR-aware channel attention to mitigate wireless channel noise  

  âœ… **End-to-end JSCC framework** for image SR  
  - Outperforms **Deep-JSCC** and traditional separated source-channel coding (SSCC)  

- **Performance:**  
  PRAF-JSCC achieves **better PSNR/SSIM** and more stable transmission across different SNRs, while maintaining **lower inference time** than existing methods.
